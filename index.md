# Mechanical Engineering
Hi, I am Allan. You prolly know me from interaction with Nanosatellite Design and Developments
The things that interest me include: Ansys, SOLIDWORKS, MATLAB and Python.

## Ansys
I use Ansys in my day to day work to carry out Finite Element Analysis as part of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE).

## SOLIDWORKS
I used solidworks to craft and design mechanical parts and components. I then convert the components to .IGES file which I then import to Ansys for simulation.

## MATLAB
I also use this to carry out simulation together with simulink.

## Python
This is the latest addition to my skill set and I am so proud of myself for learning this cause it has opened opportunities such as the possibility to learn scripting for Ansys whose documentation can be found in #### pyAnsys.

```
static_sys = GetTemplate(TemplateName="Static Analysis")
```

# Tasks

- [X] Learn Scripting for Ansys
- [X] Add projects to my portfolio
- [ ] Finish SOLIDWORKS projects

add my interest to my profile
